Model Stacking
==============

## Overivew
This model was built post-competition to test out model stacking concept.

## Folder Naming convention
Folders named as follows: <<model>><<model id>>_<<stack level>>

Example:  
* rf1_1:  random forest model 1 at stack level 1
* rf2_1:  random forest model 2 at stack level 1
* gbm1_1:  gbm model 1 at stack level 1
* rf1_2:  random forest model 1 at stack level 2
